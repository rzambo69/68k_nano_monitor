# 68k_nano_monitor
Very simple (and unoptimized) monitor program for the 68k_nano SBC from Matt Sarnoff

I built Matt's 68k SBC because I had a spare Motorola 68000 CPU. I think it is a simple and quite powerful board, and it
worked fine immediately after power on.

I never played with 68k processor, and above all I never coded with assembly. Unfortunately the 68k_nano firmware is just
a sort of simple BIOS, as told by Matt. So, in order to be able to play with the computer I tried to write a simple 
monitor program. My purpose is just to insert simple machine language routine into memory and try to run them.

As said it would need optimization and some error checking routines for the typed commands and the hex numbers. It's not
so simple for me and it requires a lot of time. Maybe in the future...
